# Title: Store Sales Prediction with GUI using ML Models

# Project Overview:
  In this project, our objective is to develop a sales prediction model for Corporation Favorita, a prominent Ecuadorian-based grocery retailer. The goal is to create a more accurate model that can predict the unit sales of thousands of items sold across various Favorita stores. To enhance the user experience, we will build a graphical user interface (GUI) using Streamlit. This GUI will collect inputs from clients and utilize machine learning models to provide accurate sales predictions.

# Key Objectives:
 1. Develop a robust machine learning model for sales prediction: We will leverage historical sales data from Favorita to train and fine-tune our machine learning models. The objective is to build a reliable model that can effectively predict the unit sales of different items.
 2. Create a user-friendly GUI using Streamlit: To streamline the sales prediction process, we will design and implement a GUI using Streamlit. The GUI will serve as an interactive platform where clients can input relevant information, such as item details, store location, and other factors that impact sales. The interface will provide an intuitive and user-friendly experience.

3. Incorporate ML models for accurate predictions: Utilizing various machine learning algorithms such as regression, ensemble methods, or deep learning, we will train models that capture the complex relationships between sales and different factors. These models will be integrated into the GUI to generate accurate sales predictions based on user inputs.

4. Evaluate and optimize model performance: We will thoroughly evaluate the performance of our models using appropriate metrics and validation techniques. By fine-tuning the models and optimizing their parameters, we aim to achieve the highest possible prediction accuracy.

5. Provide actionable insights and visualizations: Alongside sales predictions, we will offer actionable insights and visualizations to help clients understand the key factors influencing sales. This will enable stakeholders to make informed decisions and implement effective strategies to improve store performance.

# Project Deliverables:
1. Machine learning model for sales prediction.
2. Streamlit-based GUI for input collection and sales predictions.
3. Comprehensive documentation of the project, including methodology, model architecture, and evaluation results.
4. Visualizations and insights on key factors impacting sales.
